1. FIRST; Install the Subutai plugin for Firefox or Chrome;
          FF; https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/subutai-e2e-plugin/
          Chrome; https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/subutai-e2e-plugin/ffddnlbamkjlbngpekmdpnoccckapcnh?hl=en

2. (On Firefox) Once the plugin is installed you will be asked to generate a new PGP key. If you have PGP/GPG on your
    system already, close that box and go to "Import" in the top right corner. To get the key from GPG, do;

        gpg --list-keys                 #locate the KEYID you want to export
        gpg --export --armour KEYID     #long text produced. Copy that and paste into browser.


3. Then on the server, "Debian minimal, no raid" from server4you. See servers.txt

4. Install ZFS. This may take quite a while, since it is built from source.
    apt-get install zfs-dkms
    modprobe zfs

5. Create a "subutai" zpool
    umount /mnt/disk1
    zpool create subutai /dev/sdb

6. Create a "subutai/fs" dataset mounted on /var/lib/lxc
    zfs create -o mountpoint=/var/lib/lxc subutai/fs

7. Install Linux Containers (LXC), Subutai doesn't use Docker.
    apt-get install lxc

8. add "deb http://deb.subutai.io/subutai master main" to /etc/apt/sources.list
    echo deb http://deb.subutai.io/subutai master main >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/subutai.list

9. Install Subutai. NOTE: the nsexec, subutai, subutai-ovs and subutai-p2p can't be verified. Answer Yes to that.
    apt-get update && apt-get install subutai

   Also, there might be an error, which can safely be ignored
           Job for rng-tools.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
           See "systemctl status rng-tools.service" and "journalctl -xe" for details.
           invoke-rc.d: initscript rng-tools, action "start" failed.
           ‚óè rng-tools.service
              Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/rng-tools; generated; vendor preset: enabled)

                 CPU: 2ms

10. The Resource Host should now be up and running, but we need to make it a Peer on the Subutai Bazaar
    subutai import management

   This will end with output of
            INFO[2018-05-04 04:43:11] ********************
            INFO[2018-05-04 04:43:11] Subutai Management UI will be shortly available at https://<someip>:8443

11. Use the HTTPS URL in step 10 and open it with the browser. It will present a login screen, and a new password must
   be given. Please use root password of the server; 28YgtfsFi2gbr

12. In upper right corner, "Register Peer" (which is actually a Resource Host) and fill in the form. Make it Private
    for eosgermany use only.

13. Then the Resource Host will be available at https://masterbazaar.subutai.io.
    It is NOT on prod (https://bazaar.subutai.io) since the prod uses btrfs and "no way in hell they will survive
    more than a few weeks", according to director of infrastructure.
